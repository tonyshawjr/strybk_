# PLAN - Strybk_ Development Roadmap

Purpose: High-level roadmap linking to detailed requirements, design decisions, and current tasks.

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a minimalist book publishing tool that works on shared hosting (PHP/MySQL).

**Timeline**: 4 phases, with Phase 1 broken into 5 milestones for rapid iteration.

## Phases

### Phase 1 - MVP (Current Focus)
Delivering core functionality in small, testable chunks.

#### Milestone 1: Setup ‚Üê **CURRENT**
- Database installer wizard
- User authentication
- Basic project structure
- [See current tasks](./TASKS.md#today-phase-1---milestone-1-setup)

#### Milestone 2: Books
- Library view
- Book CRUD operations
- Cover uploads
- Visibility controls
- [See planned tasks](./TASKS.md#next-phase-1---milestone-2-books)

#### Milestone 3: Pages
- Markdown editor integration
- Page creation/editing
- Auto-generated TOC
- Word counting

#### Milestone 4: Reorder & Navigation
- Drag-drop page ordering
- Reader navigation
- Breadcrumb trails

#### Milestone 5: Polish
- CSS design system
- Typography refinement
- Mobile responsiveness
- Hostinger deployment

### Phase 2 - Media & Polish
- Picture pages with captions
- Section dividers
- In-text image uploads
- Full-screen reading mode
- Keyboard shortcuts

### Phase 3 - Extras & Expansion
- Version history
- Export functionality (Markdown/HTML)
- Search capabilities
- Theming options

### Phase 4 - Future Collaboration (Optional)
- Multi-user support
- Role-based permissions
- Private book sharing
- Team invitations

## Metrics

### Success Metrics
- **Phase 1**: Working on shared hosting, basic book creation/publishing
- **Phase 2**: Rich media support, polished reading experience
- **Phase 3**: Power user features, data portability
- **Phase 4**: Team collaboration capabilities

### Quality Gates
- All PRs must pass @smoke tests
- Main branch requires full test suite green
- Zero @critical test failures in production
- Installation completes < 5 minutes
- Page loads < 2 seconds on shared hosting

## Technical Decisions

Key architectural choices documented in [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md#adrs-architecture-decision-records):
- Vanilla PHP for hosting compatibility
- Markdown over WYSIWYG for portability
- File-based uploads for simplicity
- SimpleMDE for editor experience

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Scope Creep**: Strict phase boundaries, milestone-based delivery
2. **Hosting Limits**: File size validation, efficient queries
3. **Complexity**: Start simple, iterate based on feedback
4. **Testing**: Playwright from day one, smoke tests on every PR
